# eliKAASbot
This is eliKAASbot, a multi-purpose bot, like [Mattata (made by Matthew)](https://github.com/matthewhesketh/mattata)

For the cleverbot responses I'm using a libary called [Cleverbot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cleverbot)

## Installation

#### cd into your home directory
``` bash
cd ~
```
#### clone the respository
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/elisaado/eliKAASbot.git
```
#### Install the dependencies
``` bash
pip3 install cleverbot
pip3 install python-telegram-bot --upgrade
```
#### cd Into the directory of eliKAASbot
``` bash
cd eliKAASbot
```
#### Now you need to edit the python file, edit the ownerId, botName, etc. 
Of course you can edit it with whatever editor you want but I find nano the simplest.
``` bash
nano main.py
```
#### Now you can start the bot with
``` bash
python3 main.py
```
